# Basic-AI-template-made-for-Linux-Mint
I made this template for Linux mint so I don't know if it will work for Windows or any other OS.
Please note that it is still in the alpha phase, this is a rough release of an AI that comes with a few templates and some vocabulary.
This project requires Python version: 3, and it comes with some installations.
To train this AI, try talking back and forth to yourself as if you are meeting someone for the first time. This shows the AI how conversations work.
Feel free to delete, modify, or add to the memory file.json for example: I need to remove a typo (Remove it from the database)
It is recommended to use this AI in a virtual environtment (venv) see this page to learn about virtual environments https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
In the virtual environtment you will need to install a few packages: "pip install tensorflow", "pip install numpy", "pip install playsound"
To create the venv (Virtual environtment) open the "neural_ai" file in terminal or command promt and type in "python3 -m venv ai-env" (or whatever you want to name your venv)
To activate the venv, type in "source ai-env/bin/activate"
Then install all of these one by one "pip install tensorflow", "pip install numpy", "pip install playsound"
The "playsound" package is so you can add a "pop.wav" sound for AI texting but you don't need to add one (you should still install the package so there are no errors)
