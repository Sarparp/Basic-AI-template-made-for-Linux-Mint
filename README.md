# Basic-AI-template-made-for-Linux-Mint
I made this template for Linux mint so I don't know if it will work for Windows or any other OS.
Please note that it is still in the alpha phase, this is a rough release of an AI that comes with a few templates and some vocabulary.
This project requires Python version: 3, and it comes with some installations.
To train this AI, try talking back and forth to yourself as if you are meeting someone for the first time. This shows the AI how conversations work.
Feel free to delete, modify, or add to the memory file.json for example: I need to remove a typo (Remove it from the database)
